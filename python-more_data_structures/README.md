# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

## Project Overview
This project covers advanced Python data structures including **sets** and **dictionaries**, as well as the use of **lambda functions**, **map**, **filter**, and **reduce**.  

The purpose of this project is to deepen understanding of Python's data handling capabilities and practice writing clean, functional code that follows Pythonic principles.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will be able to:
- Understand and use sets and their methods.
- Differentiate when to use sets versus lists.
- Iterate through sets efficiently.
- Work with dictionaries, understand keys and values, and iterate through them.
- Understand lambda functions and their usage.
- Apply `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` to manipulate data efficiently.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8.5 (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)
- All files are executable and start with:
  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/python3
