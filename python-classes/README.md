# Python - Classes and Objects

## Description
This project is part of the ALU Higher Level Programming curriculum.  
It introduces the concept of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python, focusing on defining and using classes and objects effectively.

The goal of this project is to understand how classes work, how to define attributes and methods, and how to use encapsulation, abstraction, and properties in Python.

- What is `self`  
- What is a **method**  
- What is the special `__init__` method and how to use it  
- What is **data abstraction**, **data encapsulation**, and **information hiding**  
- What is a **property**  
- The difference between an **attribute** and a **property** in Python  
- How to dynamically create new attributes for existing instances
