# JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

## Description
This project focuses on understanding JavaScript objects, classes, inheritance,
scopes, and closures. It introduces object-oriented programming concepts using
modern JavaScript (ES6) syntax and helps build a strong foundation in how JavaScript
handles data, functions, and memory.

All scripts are written to be executed with Node.js and follow semistandard
(JavaScript Standard Style with semicolons).
