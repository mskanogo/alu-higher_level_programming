# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Description
This project introduces Python **lists** and **tuples**.  
You will learn how to manipulate sequences, understand their differences, and apply them in programs.

## Learning Objectives
- Why Python programming is awesome  
- What are lists and how to use them  
- Similarities and differences between strings and lists  
- Common list methods and how to use them  
- How to use lists as stacks and queues  
- What list comprehensions are  
- What are tuples and how to use them  
- When to use tuples vs lists  
- What is a sequence, tuple packing, and unpacking  
- How to use the `del` statement

## Requirements
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS / Python 3.8.5  
- All files executable, end with a new line  
- First line of each file: `#!/usr/bin/python3`  
- Code must follow `pycodestyle` (v2.7.*)
