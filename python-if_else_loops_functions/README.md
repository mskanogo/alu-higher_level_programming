# Python - if/else, loops, functions

## Description
This project is part of the ALU Higher Level Programming curriculum.  
It introduces control flow in Python — using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements, loops, and basic function definitions.  
By completing these tasks, we learn how to make decisions, iterate through sequences, and create reusable pieces of code.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you should be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- Why Python programming is awesome  
- Why indentation is so important in Python  
- How to use the `if`, `if ... else` statements  
- How to use comments  
- How to assign values to variables  
- How to use the `while` and `for` loops  
- How is Python’s `for` loop different from C’s  
- How to use the `break` and `continue` statements  
- How to use `else` clauses on loops  
- What does the `pass` statement do, and when to use it  
- How to use `range`  
- What is a function and how to use functions  
- What does a function return if it does not use any return statement  
- Scope of variables  
- What’s a traceback  
- What are arithmetic operators and how to use them  

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`  
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using **python3 (version 3.8.5)**  
- All files should end with a new line  
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`  
- A `README.md` file at the root of the folder is mandatory  
- Code should follow the **pycodestyle** style (version 2.7.*)  
- All files must be executable  
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`  

## Tasks

Program that prints the last digit of a random number with conditional text.

### 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
Program that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

### 3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
Prints all lowercase letters except `q` and `e`.

### 4. Hexadecimal printing
